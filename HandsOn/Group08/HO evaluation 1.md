    Analysis
        - The analysis.html file does not contain the license of the dataset to be generated.
    Ontology
    RDF data
        - The RDF file does not follow the resource naming strategy.
        - The IRIs are not correctly written (check the "~iri" at the end of them).
        - Domain names cannot be only a word. At least they must end with a .something (e.g., ".com").
        - Some datatypes are not correct.
    Take into account that the review has been performed over a previous version of the hands-on. Some of the defects found may have been already fixed.
