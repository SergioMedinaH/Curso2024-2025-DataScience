    Analysis
    Ontology
        - Check that all class names start with capital letter.
        - The different types of parkings should be a hierarchy in the ontology.
    RDF data
        - Verify that the class and property names used in the RDF data are the same as those used in the ontology.
    Take into account that the review has been performed over a previous version of the hands-on. Some of the defects found may have been already fixed.
