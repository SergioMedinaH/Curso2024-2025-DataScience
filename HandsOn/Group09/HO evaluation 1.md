    Analysis
        - The resource naming strategy is not defined for individuals.
        - The resource naming strategy should use different paths for ontology resources and individuals.
    Ontology
        - The domain and/or range of some property is not defined.
        - You are creating classes for the values of some datatype properties. However the values of datatype properties are related to datatypes, not classes.
    RDF data
        - URIs are encoded as strings.
        - Values are encoded as instances.
        - Review the way in which you define URIs. The URI of an address (for example) should not depend on the spots being there.
    Take into account that the review has been performed over a previous version of the hands-on. Some of the defects found may have been already fixed.
